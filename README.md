R-Examples

Some examples of R scripts I've written:
==========
The following scripts are intended do demonstrate my proficiency with R.  I've tried to keep them simple yet informative:


1.) MarketAutoRegressionPlots.R - Gathers closing stock quotes from Yahoo and creates an autoregressive log price model.  Plots of the fitted values to the actuals, histograms of the residuals with normal distributions overplotted for comparison, and predictive distrbutions of the "next day" closing price are generated.  Plot names arplots.png, arplots-hist.png, and arpredict-hist.png are outputs.
