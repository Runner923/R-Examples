R-Examples
==========

Some examples of R scripts I've written:
1.) MarketAutoRegressionPlots.R - Gathers closing stock quotes from Yahoo and creates an autoregressive log price model.  Plots 
of the fitted values to the actuals, histograms of the residuals with normal distributions overplotted for comparison, and 
predictive distrbutions of the "next day" closing price are generated.
